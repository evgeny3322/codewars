<!--A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?-->

<!--Return True if yes, False otherwise :)-->
<script>
    function hero(bullets, dragons) {
        return bullets >= dragons * 2 ? true : false;
    }

    hero(0, 1);  // false
    hero(4, 2);  // true
